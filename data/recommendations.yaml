      - Soba is my favorite Japanese food. It’s a summer food. The noodles are served chilled, and you dip them in their sauce. Soba noodles are so flavorful that you end the meal with a tea made from the noodle broth itself. Just try to sound a little more refined than me when I, questioning this, referred to the tea as “pasta water”. At Azabu Kawakamian in particular I recommend their walnut soba course meal.

      - It is a rare experience to encounter an entirely new cuisine, even rarer to encounter one that, sadly, may not exist for much longer. Uyghurs are the mostly-Muslim ethnic group living in Eastern China who are [victims of active genocide](https://www.nytimes.com/topic/subject/uyghurs) at the hands of the Chinese government. Their food is a delicious blend of Turkish, Indian, and Chinese influences. Just one meal at Silk Road Tarim offers such a diversity of flavors that you will leave fully aware that the world is at risk of losing a particularly beautiful culture.

      - We all know the one food you want to try in Japan. You _can_ treat yourself to high-end, omakase sushi. I have; it’s delicious. But you don’t _need_ to spend a lot to eat great sushi in Japan. Usually filled with Japanese twenty-somethings, this is my favorite, casual spot.
      - Iroha is the center of Naka-meguro, a neighborhood I could happily spend months in without leaving. Put your name down, and while you wait for your table you can stroll along the Meguro river, do some shopping at [Migratory](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fF54Dv62zTPYCwrm8), have a drink at [Sidewalk Stand](https://maps.app.goo.gl/P84gBAZBeASTcTxS8) or [Antonic](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NKNTymFn9JZ6taCy7), or whatever you like. Naka-meguro is a joy to explore.

      - When people ask me what food I miss most from Japan, they look at me quite funny when I answer honestly, _pizza_. “Pizza is not Japanese food,” you might think. Well, you’d be wrong.
      - The Japanese have adopted Neapolitan pizza and applied to it their infamous work ethic, dedication, and artistry. Most chefs must apprentice for at least a year before they are allowed to make pizza for customers. These chefs take their craft, but not themselves, seriously. Every chef I met was goofy and friendly, especially [Bun san](https://www.instagram.com/angie.mieux/), the chef extraordinaire of Savoy, who so proudly and genuinely relishes in making his guests happy.

      - I would buy a flight to Tokyo just to have one more meal at this place. Kameido Gyoza only serves gyoza, five to a plate. At the end of your meal they count up your plates and hand you a bill. 
      - The main branch is on the east side of Tokyo, in Koto City, down the river from Tokyo Skytree. East Tokyo was less destroyed during the war and seems to be less popular with expats. In contrast West Tokyo, which has more foreigner-friendly housing and international chains, the neighborhoods to the east retain an older and purely Japanese character that I mostly experienced outside of Tokyo.

      - Tokyo is filled with small, narrow restaurants with only counter seating. Part of the fun of these places is that you can banter with the chef while they make your meal. In fact, good conversation is not just expected, but part of how chefs of small shops compete for your business. That is, of course, only if you speak Japanese.
      - At _Ta-im_, named for the Hebrew word for delicious, you don’t just get stupendous Israeli food, but a chance to experience this part of Tokyo culture in English. Chef Dan Zuckerman is goofy, kind, and welcoming. He’ll likely want to know if you’re Jewish, and if applicable, while brandishing a chef’s knife, will graciously offer take you back into the kitchen and convert. I recommend the lamb shakshuka.

      - Venturing out of central Tokyo – into the “suburbs” – is a fun opportunity to imagine what it would be like to really live in Tokyo. These mostly single family home neighborhoods are where you would likely settle if you were raising kids in the biggest city in the world. Smaller, quieter, and greener, these little towns are still delightfully dense, walkable, and filled with great food.
      - You can find Tantantei off a winding park that follows the Kanda river, dotted with playgrounds and little league fields. Still accessible by subway, it’s not a trek, but I doubt many tourists would venture this far. Go for a quieter afternoon and a glimpse into the safe, park-filled communities that grant Japanese children so much freedom.

    text:
      - Yakitori, which literally translates to grilled chicken, is small portions of skewered meat and vegetables. They can be found as an _izakaya_, a small, quite casual bar with a menu of small plates for sharing, or formal sit-down restaurants. Tsukada is one of the nicer options and is my friends’ favorite.
      - Some yakitori musts are _tsukune_, chicken meatballs with an egg yolk dipping sauce; _reba_, chicken liver; _hatsu_, chicken heart; and torikawa, “strips of fatty chicken skin, which have been grilled until crispy.”⁵ In many places, you can simply ask for _omakase_, and the staff will feed you until you are full. A good yakitori place will leave you wondering why we waste so many delicious chicken parts here at home.

      - Down a narrow walkway off the enchanting Arisugawa-no-miya Memorial Park, NEM is a haven, a refuge. The path towards it will seem like you’re walking to someone’s home, and that is exactly what it feels like inside. Strictly wifi and device free, and decorated like you’ve found a modern, secluded cabin, NEM is for enjoying your coffee with a friend or with a book. I recommend whatever beans he recommends plus the egg salad sandwich.

      - My notes for Fuglen just read, “damn good coffee.” Tokyo is world-renowned for its coffee scene. In particular, its pour-over scene – which is called “hand-pour” in Japan – and Fuglen is my favorite hand-pour destination. I’ve been fortunate enough to aslo visit one of their original locations in Oslo, and, lucky for you, I like their Yoyogi spot better. Near the park and along a lovely, pedestrianized street, Fuglen is likely to be popular but well worth the wait.
  ØL:

    text:
      - Named for the Nordic word for beer, ØL is your standard Norwegian craft brewery and Mexican taco shop, a combination that would seem out of place in any other city. The beers are top notch, the tacos superb. Surprising too considering it’s in the heart of Shibuya, ØL has some of the most generous patio seating in Tokyo.
  JOLLYS:

      - "If you’re curious about life as an expat in Tokyo, there’s no better place to start than Jollys. Part liquor store part bar (or a “slashee” as Chicagoans might say), Jolly’s tries to collect as many cheap, shitty beers from everyone’s home country as they can. They have PBR! And the worst beer I’ve ever tried: Victoria Bitters. Luckily, a jovial Australian was kind enough to take it off my hands. At its core, Jolly’s is a place for meeting people."

      - Ride the subway two hours heading west and you will end up on the Ōme Line, snaking along the Tama River. The river valley offers everything. It’s the first place I went outdoor bouldering and where I regret not planning a kayaking trip.
      - Moegi no Yu Onsen is in Oku-Tama, the end of the line, and is where we would end most days of hiking from mountain-top shrine to mountain-top shrine. You can eat there or hop on the train and get dinner back in Tokyo. Even if gets late, the sun begins to set on your hike, and you realize you forgot to pack flashlights, you will still have time to soak. Trains run until midnight.

      - At the base of a volcano – which you can hike! – this onsen is my absolute favorite. The smell of sulfur is overwhelming at first, but soon your brain will tune it out and you will forget you ever noticed it. Your skin will never be softer. I wish I could hike and soak here every weekend.
      - The baths are labeled by temperature. I suggest starting with the lowest. And I can only speak for the men’s bath, but you’re likely to find elderly locals egging on tourists to try the 48˚C tub. I got as far as my big toe.

      - This grand onsen resort is particularly well-known for its food and was recommended to me by a friend who is also particularly well-known for her food. Even as someone who has limited stamina for hot baths, I recommend budgeting a whole day. You will not want to leave. Yukemuri-no-Shou offers such a variety of baths, spas, and napping rooms that you will feel genuinely adventurous in your relaxation.

      - This bath is nowhere near Tokyo, but it’s worth mentioning. It’s one of the rare, mixed-gender onsens – a fact my Japanese friends conveniently forgot to mention. But I’m glad they didn’t, because if they had I likely wouldn’t have gone.
      - All onsens are fed by natural hot spring, but rarely do you get to see the spring itself, to feel it bubble out of the earth like placing your hand over the jet of a hot tub. Even rarer do you need to schedule your visit for when the tide is out. The whole experience felt primal, especially since Hirauchi Kaichu Onsen is not a formal business but just some warm tide pools found the rocky shoreline. Locals have been relaxing here [for over 400 years](https://yesyakushima.com/yakushima-seaside-onsens-hot-springs/).
      - Attendees naturally segregated themselves and the rocks provided decent privacy. When traveling around rural Japan, if you find yourself near something similar, it will be very worth checking out.
